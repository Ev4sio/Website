        <p>Hi! I am Francis Roux.</p>
        <p>
          I've worked for 15 years in video game studios as a physics
          programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2009, I started working at <b>Eden Games</b>, on the physics engine
          of <b>Test Drive Unlimited 2</b>, available on <b>Xbox360</b>,
          <b>PS3</b> and <b>PC</b>.
        </p>
        <div class="img_prez">
          <img src="resources/images/game_tdu2_1.jpg" alt="TDU2" />
          <img src="resources/images/game_tdu2_4.jpg" alt="TDU2" />
          <img src="resources/images/game_tdu2_2.jpg" alt="TDU2" />
        </div>
        <p>
          As of 2014, the studio decided to develop racing games for mobile
          phones. At that point, I started working with Unity. Taking advantage
          of my experience, I developed a simplified physics engine in C# to
          meet the performance of mobile phones. <b>Gear.Club Mobile</b>,
          <b>F1 Mobile</b>, or even <b>Gear.Club Unlimited</b> on
          <b>Nintendo Switch</b> now use this engine.
        </p>
        <div class="img_prez">
          <img src="resources/images/game_gear.club.jpg" alt="Gear.Club" />
          <img src="resources/images/game_gcu.jpg" alt="GCU" />
          <img src="resources/images/game_gcu2.png" alt="GCU2" />
          <img src="resources/images/game_f1_mobile.jpg" alt="F1 Mobile" />
        </div>
        <p>
          I then carried on a one-year mission at <b>Ubisoft</b>, to participate
          in the development of <b>The Crew 2</b>, but I never lost my interest
          in <b>Unity</b>. However, I was aware of the limitations of the
          integration of <b>PhysX</b> into <b>Unity</b>. In a racing game, it is
          essential to control the different collisions that apply to a
          vehicleâ€™s chassis, to be able to modify or even delete the contact
          points before the solver takes them into account. Being suddenly
          stopped by a sidewalk a few inches high when establishing our fastest
          lap is frustrating! Although this functionality already exists in
          <b>PhysX</b>, it is unfortunately not available in <b>Unity</b>. This
          observation marked the start of the <b>Ev4sio.Physics</b> project,
          which aims to provide access to all the features of <b>PhysX</b> in
          <b>Unity</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, the project is sufficiently advanced to be distributed, so that
          it can still evolve thanks to the <b>Unity</b> community.
        </p>
        <p>I really hope you'll enjoy it!</p>
